//MARK: INITIALIZERS
// The standard initializer that comes with all structs is called a "memberwise initializer"
struct User {
    var username: String

    init() {
        username = "Anonymous"
        print("Creating a new user!")
    }
}

// user.username will be set to "Anonymous", to change that you must create an instance of user, and then manipulate it
var user = User()
user.username = "twostraws"

//MARK: REFERING TO THE CURRENT INSTANCE
// Self helps you distinguish between the property and the parameter â€“ self.name refers to the property, whereas name refers to the parameter.
struct Person {
    var name: String

    init(name: String) {
        print("\(name) was born!")
        self.name = name
    }
}

//MARK: LAZY PROPERTIES

struct FamilyTree {
    init() {
        print("Creating family tree!")
    }
}

// Adding the word "lazy" in front of a property means it will not be part of the instances of the structure unless accessed
struct Person2 {
    var name: String
    lazy var familyTree = FamilyTree()

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

var ed = Person2(name: "Ed")
// Because the property family tree is lazy, it will not be a part of ed until its accessed at least once
ed.familyTree
