//MARK: POSSIBLE PROJECTS

//MARK: FINANCE TRACKER

// This would be an app that tracks your financial purchaes and shows you a list and graph of what you spend your money on.

// Add on: The user could set a monthly spending goal and it would compare how much they are spending to the goal

// Add on: The user sets spending goals for each catagory and compares their monthly spending in each catagory

//MARK: SCREEN TIME MONITOR

// The user would set a desired daily screen time

// They would then input their daily screen time, and the app would give them feedback regarding if they went over or under, and would tell them how to improve

// Not exactly sure how this would be different from the screen time app built into settings, but I think it would be focused around helping the user cut down on screen time
